  Transposable-element annotation and curation for plant genomes (Vitis).

  Do not hook a classifier-only tool as a genome-wide scanner.

# vitis-te

EDTA is the usual de novo starter. It is not a finished library.

## Order

1. EDTA per assembly (`--species others` unless it is rice/maize)
2. TEtrimmer for boundaries
3. TEsorter for lineage
4. Manual spot-check (LTR false positives, LINE/SINE misses, CDS contamination)
5. Curated lib: drop CDS → CD-HIT ~85% → 80-80 collapse
6. Re-annotate with `--curatedlib` and/or RepeatMasker
7. LTR age + LAI only after the lib is curated

## Red lines

- Do not treat EDTA raw output as a gold-standard TE library.
- Classifier-only tools (e.g. homology classifiers) are for **naming**, not for scanning a genome or replacing trim.
- Do not publish another group's raw TE calls as yours.

## EDTA starter

```bash
EDTA.pl --genome assembly.fa --species others --sensitive 1 --anno 1 --threads 32
```
